///
/// Exactly ONE trading socket is ever open per app. Perpl caps a wallet at 4 concurrent trading connections (shared

/// in to the socket alone. The key, the socket and the keep-alive live exactly as long as the session: `end()` drops
/// all three (`MeraSessionLifecycle`), nothing reconnects while it is locked, and orders need the live session and fit
