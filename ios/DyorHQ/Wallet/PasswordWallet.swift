/* Deterministic email + password wallet. The private key is derived from the email + password and NEVER stored
   anywhere but this device's Keychain — the same email + password always regenerate the same wallet on any device,
   so there is no backup and no verification code at log-in. The derivation lives in DyorKit's `EmailWallet` (moved
   there unchanged from this file so its vectors are pinned by `swift test`):

     v2      every new account: the password's slow seed mixed with a server pepper (the `email-pepper` Edge
             Function), so a password can't be tested offline — each guess is a rate-limited server round-trip.
     legacy  accounts created before v2: the seed alone (a "brainwallet"). Log-in still finds them, then moves the
             email to the v2 wallet of a NEW password once the user re-verifies it (`Session.logInWithPassword` →
             `bindEmailPassword(upgradingFrom:)`), and only while the legacy wallet is empty. The old password can't
             carry over: its legacy address is public, so its seed stays guessable offline.

   A wrong password silently derives a *different* wallet, and the password cannot be reset into the same wallet.
   That is why sign-up enforces a strong password (`PasswordStrength`) and the UI is blunt that the password IS the
   wallet. Users who want stronger guarantees use a passkey or import their own key. */

/// Sign-up password rules. The password is the wallet's only secret the user holds: v2 keeps it from being guessed
/// offline, but a weak one still falls to patient online guessing (or to offline guessing if the server key ever
/// leaked), so weak passwords are rejected outright.
