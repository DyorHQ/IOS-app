# Xcode Cloud runs this after each xcodebuild action. For an archive it is the SECURITY GATE of scripts/testflight.sh:
# a cloud archive goes to TestFlight without ever running that script, so the same checks run here, and a non-zero
# exit fails the archive action before its TestFlight post-action can distribute the build. The values come from the
# Secrets.xcconfig that ci_post_clone.sh writes from the workflow's environment variables (a cloud clone has no .env).
# Checked anywhere in the .xcarchive and the App Store export: every non-public Secrets.xcconfig value, keyed
# RPC-provider URLs and private-key patterns (scripts/dev/secret-scan.sh, which prints names only, never values).
# Before that, the v2 wiring gate: an archive is refused while DyorKit's v2 launchpad or Moments addresses are still
# PENDING (scripts/dev/check-launchpad-addresses.py --release), so no build ships with Launch and Publish "not live yet",
# and while a retired Moments cohort is not final on chain (momentCount equal to its pin, every coin in the retired-coin
# table, cohorts 1 and 2 paused: read-only calls to a public Monad RPC). The DyorHQ target's install-only build phase
# runs the same check first; this is the second layer. Then its Swift half and the strings gate: DyorKit's
# V2WiringTests and the strings tests under DYORHQ_RELEASE_GATE=1, so no build ships with a count that reads "1 editions".
