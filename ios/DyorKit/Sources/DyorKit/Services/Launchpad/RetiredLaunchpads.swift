/* Retired launchpads (`LaunchpadAddresses.retiredStacks`: 0x6B1C…, 0x10F3…, 0x2F02…, 0xad3d…) are SELL-ONLY (owner
   decision 2026-09-28). A coin still on a retired launchpad's bonding curve — climbing, completed but not graduated, or
   in refund mode — can be sold by its holders, and nobody can buy it: no curve buy, no developer buy through a retired
   router's `launchAndBuy`, and no swap that buys it. Each layer refuses on its own:

     - the plan builders (`LaunchpadService.buyPlan`, `launchPlan`): nothing is built, not even the approval;
     - the coin page offers Sell only (in refund mode too), and Home's token page, the Portfolio's holdings and Swap's
       "no venue" state send a holder to that page, where the curve sell is: no Swap venue routes a bonding curve, the
       live launchpad's or a retired one's (`LaunchpadService.curveHoldings`, `curveRoute(for:)`, `LaunchpadCurves.swift`);
     - Swap (`SwapEngine.buyRefusal`): no venue is asked to quote buying such a coin, read on-chain from every retired
       factory's record; a read that fails refuses too. Selling one is never checked;
     - a passkey account (`Mera.SigningPolicy.refusal`): a curve `buy` into a curve a retired factory recorded
       (`curveToToken`, read on-chain here), an approval paying anything but the coin into one, and `launchAndBuy` on a
       retired router are refused whatever the sheet declared or a Face ID approved, even if some screen built one.

   A coin that GRADUATED from a retired stack into a Monday Trade or Uniswap v4 pool is an ordinary pool token and trades
   both ways. The live stack (v2) is unaffected. */
