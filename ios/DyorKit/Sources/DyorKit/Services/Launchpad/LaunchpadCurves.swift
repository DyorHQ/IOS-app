/* A coin still on a launchpad's bonding curve (the live launchpad's once v2 is wired, or a retired one's) trades on
   that curve, from its Launch page, and nowhere else: no Swap venue routes a bonding curve, so Swap can only answer "No
   venue can route this pair". Every screen that offers a held coin a trade asks where it trades first (`CurveRoute`):

     - the Portfolio's holdings (`LaunchpadService.curveHoldings`) and Home's token page (`curveRoute(for:)`) open such
       a coin's Launch page instead of Swap: Buy and Sell on the live launchpad's curve, Sell only on a retired one's
       (`RetiredLaunchpad`). Home's launch holdings open every launch's own page already;
     - Swap's "no venue" state (`curveRoute(among:)`) points to the Launch page of a side still on a curve;
     - a coin that graduated into a pool is an ordinary pool token: it opens Swap.

   One Multicall3 read asks every known factory (`LaunchpadService.stacks`: the live one once deployed, then each retired
   one) for each coin's `getLaunchedToken` record, in that factory's own layout. While v2 is pending (address 0) the live
   stack is left out, so nothing is ever asked of address 0. A coin on a curve whose launch couldn't be read opens its
   page by reference (`.launchUnread`, `LaunchReference`), which reads it again: the board may not list it (a retired
   launchpad's sell-only coin, `Launch.listsOnBoard`), so no route ever depends on it. A check that fails is
   `.unchecked`: the screen says so and offers a way on (check again, or the Launch tab), never a dead end. */
