   (mt:23/24/25/26/27) parsed in full, and a pure per-request reducer that applies Perpl's own client-side deduplication
   (api-docs websocket.md, "Delivery Semantics & Idempotency"). A gateway ack (mt:3 code 0) only admits an order for
   forwarding; the outcome is the order's status on the stream. Nothing here does I/O: the trading client feeds it and
