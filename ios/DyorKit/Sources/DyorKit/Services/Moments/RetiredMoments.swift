/* Retired Moments cohorts (`MomentsAddresses.retiredMainnet`), CLAIM-ONLY. Cohorts 1 and 2 snapshotted the retired
   beneficiaries at publish (platform 0xf4D4…, treasury 0x5282… whose key leaked); cohort 3 pays the current fees wallet
   0x15ED… and treasury 0x5aDb…, and is retired because the v2 contracts replaced it (`MomentsAddresses.retirement`).
   Either way collecting, expiring, retrying a graduation, running a buyback, platform / treasury withdrawals and trading
   on a retired pool are all out of reach from here: on cohorts 1 and 2 each of them either pays the retired wallets or
   feeds a pool whose hook does, and the app serves no past cohort beyond what its people are owed. What stays is
   exactly that — vested coins, and the creator's own proceeds and pool fees. The service below is v1 (`generation`),
   so it never sends a v2-only getter to a retired cohort. */
