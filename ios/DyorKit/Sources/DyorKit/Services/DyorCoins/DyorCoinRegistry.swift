/// Every DyorHQ coin (`DyorCoin`), read from the factories themselves: each launchpad stack — the live one and every
/// retired one, 0x6B1C included, which is still open on chain — and each Moments cohort, c1–c4 (cohort 3 is still open on
/// chain too). One source for "is this a DyorHQ coin, and what is its picture" for the icons, the badges, the own-coin
/// rule and prices; it reveals nothing about the wallet, since it reads every coin, not the ones held.
///
/// - **Enumeration** (`refresh`), the primary path: each factory's `launchCount()` / `momentCount()`, then the launches
///   (`getLaunches`) or Moments (`getMoment`) not read before, then each new coin's record in its factory, name, symbol
///   and picture — three Multicall3 reads in all today (7 launches, 6 Moments). How far each factory's list has been
///   read is kept (`DyorCoinStore`), so a later refresh reads only the counts and what is new.
/// - **Point proof** (`prove`), for a held address not seen yet: first every factory's count, and a factory whose count
///   is what was read of its list (its checkpoint) has named every coin it has, all of them known here, so it isn't
///   asked about the address. Each other launchpad's `getLaunchedToken(coin)` and cohort's `momentIdByCoin(coin)`; a
///   launch counts when a record exists and names this coin, a Moment when `getMoment(id).coin` is this coin. An answer
///   that is missing makes it unknown — shown as today — never "not DyorHQ"; "not DyorHQ" is kept for this session only,
///   and only after every factory answered. After a complete refresh, a wallet holding a thousand airdropped tokens
///   costs one read (the counts), not one per 22 tokens.
/// - **Ingest** of launches and Moments other screens read (Home, Portfolio, Send, a launch or publish that just
///   settled): each coin not known yet is proven, so only a factory's own record admits one — never a value handed in.
///
/// Membership never comes from anything a token says about itself: no call ever goes to a candidate token until a
/// factory has named it. A coin's name, symbol and picture are its creator's strings, which anyone launching for 5 MON
/// can make as long as a transaction stores, or bytes that aren't text: they are read as a list's text is
/// (`Multicall.readItems`: 20 coins a read, 4 reads in flight, a coin whose read fails read again on its own), decoded
/// leniently (U+FFFD for bytes that aren't text), and a text call that fails however it is read stands in as
/// `ChainText.unreadable`. Once its factory's record names a coin, the coin is admitted whatever its text — the
/// unreadable text then makes its badge a warning (`TokenBadge`), never "DyorHQ Launch" — so no creator's text can hold
/// a factory's list back. Only the factory's own answer can: a record that is empty or names another coin (a node
/// behind the chain) or that couldn't be read stops that list there, to be read again at the next refresh. A count
/// below what was read is a node behind the chain too (the app's failover RPC can land on one): that factory's coins
/// and checkpoint stay and the refresh isn't complete; only a count that stays below it for `lowerCountGrace` (a fork
/// restarted under the same file) has that list dropped and read again from the start. Reads go on
/// the client given (the app's failover RPC), each a single Multicall3 `eth_call`. When to refresh is the app's (at
