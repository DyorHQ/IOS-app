/* DyorHQ coins: every coin a DyorHQ launchpad (the live one and each retired one) or Moments cohort (c1–c4) recorded,
   proven on chain and nothing else. An address is one only because a known factory's own record says so — the
   launchpad's `getLaunchedToken(coin)` naming it, or a cohort's `momentIdByCoin(coin)` and `getMoment(id).coin` agreeing —
   never because of anything the token says about itself: a look-alike can answer `factory()` or copy a name. Launching
   and publishing are open to anyone (5 MON), so being one says where a coin was made, not that DyorHQ vouches for it:
   the label is "DyorHQ Launch" or "DyorHQ Moment", never "Verified" (`TokenBadge`), and a look-alike of a curated token
   or a symbol that isn't display-safe (`SymbolSafety`) keeps its warning whatever made it.

   `DyorCoinRegistry` holds them (read from the factories, kept in `DyorCoinStore`); `TokenBadge` and `CoinIcon` decide
   what a screen shows for a token from its entry. Nothing here changes which tokens are Unverified (IOST-12): a DyorHQ
   coin sent to a wallet unasked stays out of a send's default, Top Tokens, "funds arriving" and the picker's list. */
