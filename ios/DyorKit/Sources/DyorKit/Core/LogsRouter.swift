/* Where the app's `eth_getLogs` go, and how a wallet's history is read: the design in full, with `HistoryStore` and the
   app's `HistoryModel`.

   Monad's public endpoints each answer a range of so many blocks per `eth_getLogs`, every one far short of a wallet's
   history (about 111M blocks), measured 2026-10-08 from the owner's network:
   - rpc2.monad.xyz: 10,000 blocks; address lists and topic lists accepted; a batch of 6 ranges in one request; 4
     requests a second sustained without a refusal, about 1 in 5 refused (HTTP 429) at 11 a second. Refuses a range
     that ends past its node's head (-32014 "… is not yet available on the node").
   - rpc4.monad.xyz: 1,000 (some nodes answer any range, most refuse over 1,000); refuses a batch with -32603.
   - rpc3.monad.xyz: 1,000, a request's ranges counted together.
   - rpc1.monad.xyz: 100 (it answered any wallet-scoped range until 2026-10-08); HTTP 429 after a burst; any
     JSON-RPC batch, of any method, answered HTTP 403 "Restricted JSON RPC method" (2026-10-09): one range a request.
   - rpc.monad.xyz: 100; the app's client for everything else.
   Build 21 and earlier asked rpc1 for the whole history on every screen (about 40 scans at once when Home opened),
   split every refusal into smaller ranges and had no time limit, so on today's endpoints every history screen spun
   for minutes and showed 0.

   A range that ends past the answering node's head is refused by rpc2 alone (measured 2026-10-08/09). rpc4, rpc3 and
   rpc1 — and rpc.monad.xyz, taken to, unmeasured — answer it CLAMPED: the logs up to that node's head, those of the
   blocks past it simply missing, with no error, which reads exactly as blocks with no logs; and a node of theirs can be
   hundreds of blocks behind. In build 22 and earlier such an answer marked every block of the range read, and the next
   round read again only the 20 blocks below the newest one read: a transfer in the blocks left out was never seen, on
   any screen, however many rounds later.

   The design:
   1. One logs router, every endpoint (this file). A scan is a window of blocks; the router cuts it into ranges of
      what the endpoint answers (learned from its refusals and remembered for a day), sends them in batches, and
      moves to the next endpoint when one throttles or fails. Every `eth_getLogs` in the app goes through one gate
      (`LogsGate`): a few in flight, a few a second, so the app never throttles itself; a screen's requests go through
      it first, then the history's (or the history's first, once one has waited a moment), then the background's, one
      at a time. A scan has a budget of
      requests and seconds; past it, the caller gets what was read and exactly which blocks it covers (`LogsRead`),
      never a part passed off as the whole. A range refused for how many logs it holds is split, not taken for the
      endpoint's span. For a read whose answer is kept as coverage — the wallet's history and its spot check, which pass
      the round's head — an endpoint that clamps (`LogsEndpoint.clamps`) is asked only for blocks at least 600 below the
      head (`LogsEndpoints.headLag`): the newest blocks go to one that refuses past its head — waited for while the
      scan's deadline lasts, else left unread, a gap like any other — never to one that would answer them short. A
      screen's read, never kept, may ask any endpoint for any block, as in build 22.
   2. A history store per wallet (`HistoryStore`): five scans (transfers in and out, launchpad, fee sharing,
      Moments), each kept on disk with the blocks it covers. A refresh reads the blocks since the last one first, from
      1,200 below the newest read (`HistoryStore.overlap`) so that what a clamped answer could have left out is read
      again, in at most half its seconds; then the gaps back to the floor while its budget lasts. The cursor never
      moves past a block that wasn't read. The transfer scans read back to the wallet's first transaction (found once
      by bisection over its nonce at past blocks) or 30 days, whichever is earlier; the rest from their contracts'
      deployment.
   3. Screens publish what they have (`WalletHistoryService`, the app's `HistoryModel`): what the app recorded shows
      at once, chain history fills in behind ("Reading your history… 28%"), and a source that couldn't be read says
      so with Retry, never replacing what the last good read showed. Rounds of up to 40 requests per scan, a second
      apart, every 90 s once complete; rounds that read nothing come further apart (20 s doubling to 10 min), and
      from the third in a row the screens say what is left couldn't be read; a return to the app, a pull or a Retry
      starts a round at once. */
