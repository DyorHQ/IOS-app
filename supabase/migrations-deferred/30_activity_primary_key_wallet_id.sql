-- 30_activity_primary_key_wallet_id — step B of scoping activity row ids to their wallet (security audit 2026-09-26,
-- SB-5). Step A is migration 25.
--
-- DEFERRED: this file lives outside supabase/migrations on purpose, so no `db push` applies it early. Apply it only
-- once the first iOS build that upserts activity with ?on_conflict=wallet,id is the MINIMUM build
-- (app_config 'ios'.min_build, migration 28). Older builds upsert with on_conflict=id, which PostgREST refuses (42P10)
-- as soon as no unique constraint on id alone exists — their activity mirror would stop syncing.
-- Before applying: set v_required_build below to that build number (the guard refuses while it is 0, and while the
-- live min_build is lower), then move this file into supabase/migrations/ so the repository matches the database.
--
-- What it does: the primary key becomes (wallet, id) and the id-only uniqueness goes (the (wallet, id) constraint from
-- migration 25 is dropped too, since the new primary key is the same index). A row id is then only unique within its
-- wallet, so another wallet's row with the same id can no longer block a victim's upsert. Idempotent.
--
-- Reverse (only while no two wallets share an id):
--   alter table public.activity drop constraint activity_pkey;
--   alter table public.activity add constraint activity_pkey primary key (id);
--   alter table public.activity add constraint activity_wallet_id_key unique (wallet, id);
-- Verify after apply:
--   select conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) from pg_constraint
--    where conrelid = 'public.activity'::regclass and contype in ('p', 'u');   -- activity_pkey PRIMARY KEY (wallet, id) only
