-- 23_default_privileges_least_privilege — close the two default grants migrations 18 and 22 left open (security audit
-- 2026-09-26, SB-8).
--
-- 1. New functions. The schema's default privileges for role postgres still grant EXECUTE on every NEW function to
--    anon and authenticated (and PostgreSQL grants it to PUBLIC), so the next SECURITY DEFINER function anyone adds is
--    callable with the publishable key unless its author remembers to revoke it — exactly what migration 18 had to fix
--    for three functions. From now on a new function is executable only by its owner (and the service role, which
--    every migration here grants explicitly); a function that a policy or the app must call gets an explicit
--    `grant execute … to authenticated` (or anon) in its own migration. Existing functions are unchanged: app_wallet()
--    keeps its grants (every RLS policy calls it), and trigger functions need no EXECUTE grant to fire.
-- 2. Table privileges no API role can use. Migration 22 revoked INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE; REFERENCES, TRIGGER and
--    MAINTAIN (PostgreSQL 17) were never revoked. PostgREST uses none of them. SELECT (and authenticated's writes, all
--    behind RLS) are unchanged.
--
-- The iOS app and the web app call no RPC with an API key, so nothing they do changes. Idempotent.
--
-- Reverse:
--   alter default privileges for role postgres grant execute on functions to public;
--   alter default privileges for role postgres in schema public grant execute on functions to anon, authenticated;
--   grant references, trigger, maintain on all tables in schema public to anon, authenticated;
--   alter default privileges for role postgres in schema public grant references, trigger, maintain on tables to anon, authenticated;
-- Verify after apply:
--   select defaclobjtype, defaclacl from pg_default_acl d join pg_namespace n on n.oid = d.defaclnamespace
--    where n.nspname = 'public' and pg_get_userbyid(d.defaclrole) = 'postgres';   -- f: no anon/authenticated/PUBLIC
--   select count(*) from information_schema.role_table_grants where table_schema = 'public'
--    and grantee in ('anon', 'authenticated') and privilege_type in ('REFERENCES', 'TRIGGER');   -- 0

-- PUBLIC's EXECUTE on functions is a GLOBAL default (hard-wired by PostgreSQL), and a per-schema default can only add
-- to the global one, never remove from it, so PUBLIC must be revoked globally for role postgres; anon and authenticated
-- were granted per schema, so they are revoked per schema. Supabase-managed schemas (auth, storage, …) create their
-- functions as other roles and are unaffected.
alter default privileges for role postgres revoke execute on functions from public;
alter default privileges for role postgres in schema public revoke execute on functions from anon, authenticated;

revoke references, trigger, maintain on all tables in schema public from anon, authenticated;
alter default privileges for role postgres in schema public revoke references, trigger, maintain on tables from anon, authenticated;
