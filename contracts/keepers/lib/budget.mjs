// every send whose outcome is unknown (counted at its worst case, gas limit x gas price).
//
// The spend guard (build 17, K3 / E8) reads it, because a price re-squatted between simulation and inclusion could
// otherwise make the keeper pay ~3 MON every 5 minutes, bounded only by its balance:
//  - per-target backoff: after a failed, reverted or unknown send, that target is not sent again for 30 minutes,
//    doubling with each further failure up to 6 hours; a success clears it;
//  - --max-spend-per-day: a send that would take the last 24 hours' spend (worst case: gas limit x gas price) over the
//    cap is not sent; the jobs keep simulating and alert, and the cap frees itself as old spend leaves the window.
//
// Times are unix seconds (numbers); amounts are wei, stored as decimal strings because JSON has no bigint.
