// Every live and retired deployment the keepers cover, read from contracts/deployments/*.json (the records are
// the source of truth for module addresses). Retired deployments stay covered: their graduations, sweeps and
// buybacks are permissionless and holders there are just as exposed.
//
// The LIVE records are required: a missing, unparsable or wrong-chain 143.json / moments-143.json throws, so the
// keeper exits 1 and pages instead of silently dropping the live stacks. Their factory addresses are also pinned
// here as a second source (`LIVE_FACTORIES`); keeper.mjs raises a critical alert when a record disagrees with the pin
// (for example after a deploy script overwrote it with simulated addresses). Update the pin together with the
// record when a new stack goes live.
