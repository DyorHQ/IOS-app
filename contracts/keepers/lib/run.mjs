// One keeper run, from parsed options (lib/options.mjs) to an exit code. keeper.mjs is only the command-line wrapper,
// so every rule here is tested with a mocked chain, sender and webhook (test/run.test.mjs).
//
// Build 17, K3 ("alerts people can live with"): alerts are posted through notify.mjs (stable keys, dedup, escalation,
// repeat cadence, "resolved" after a completed job; the channel's own payload and size limit; retries; what was not
// delivered is posted by the next run and this one exits 1), the webhook URL can come from --webhook-file, and live
// sends pass the spend guard (--max-spend-per-day, per-target backoff).
//
// Build 17, K2 ("scans see every block"): reads fall back across the --rpc-url list, cast sends through the first one
// that answers as chain 143 with a fresh head, and the run's RPC read failures become one "RPC degraded" alert
// (critical after 3 runs in a row) instead of one critical per item. A latest block more than 2 minutes old (a stuck
// or lagging RPC that still answers) is an "RPC stale" alert, critical from 10 minutes, and the run sends nothing. The
// log scans take their cursor options from here, and may use half of --max-runtime.
//
// Build 17, K1 ("sends are honest"):
//  - E7: in send mode the sending address is derived from the signer itself; a different --sim-from refuses the run,
//    and the balance check always runs for the address that pays.
//  - E6: the state file is loaded and written atomically; a corrupt one is a warning, moved aside.
//  - E9: the run has a deadline (--max-runtime): past it the run stops sending, saves its state, raises a critical
//    alert and exits 1. A watchdog (--role watchdog) never sends and marks every post.
