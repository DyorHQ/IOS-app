// The keeper jobs. Each takes a viem-like `client` (readContract / simulateContract / estimateContractGas / getBlock /
// getLogs / getBlockNumber / getGasPrice), the deployment records, a `sender` (dry-run by default, see send.mjs), a
// `reporter` and a mutable `state` object, so every job runs unchanged against Monad, a local anvil, or a mock in the
// tests.
//
// Robustness rules (2026-09-26 ops audit): one failing read never ends a run. Every cohort, launchpad and item is
// isolated (`guard`): a failure becomes a critical alert and the job moves on, so a rate limit on one read cannot
// starve the items after it. Log scans run after every retry and adapt their range to the RPC's cap.
//
// Build 17, K2: an RPC failure (HTTP error, timeout, rate limit) is never mistaken for a chain answer. A simulation or
// an optional read that fails that way skips the item for this run instead of being read as "reverts" (which could
// send the v4 fallback of a launch whose Monday graduation works) or as "function missing"; such alerts are marked
// `rpc` and the run collapses them into one "RPC degraded" warning (rpc.mjs). With --logs-cursor the scans start
// where the previous run stopped (cursor.mjs).
//
// Build 17, K3: every alert carries a stable `key` (notify.mjs posts a key when new or escalated, repeats it on a
// cadence and posts "resolved" once a completed job no longer raises it; one-off events are `once`). A job whose read
// failed is marked incomplete, so none of its alerts count as resolved. Live sends go through the spend guard
// (budget.mjs): per-target backoff after a failed send, and --max-spend-per-day.
