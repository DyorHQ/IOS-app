# Deploys a keepers bundle (ops/bundle.sh) to Fly.io (build 17 K4). Run by the owner, from their Mac, logged in with
# flyctl. It checks the bundle before anything else: made from a reviewed commit, every file matching its SHA256
# manifest, and no file the manifest does not list. The image is built from the bundle alone (the Dockerfile's test
# stage runs the keeper tests), tagged with the commit, and rolled onto the app's single Machine.
#
#   contracts/keepers/ops/deploy-fly.sh BUNDLE_DIR [--app NAME] [--remote-builder] [--check-only] [--yes]
#
#   --app NAME         the Fly app (default: the app in the bundle's fly.toml, dyorhq-keepers)
#   --remote-builder   build on Fly's remote builder instead of the local Docker daemon (the default is local)
#   --check-only       verify the bundle and print the fly command, then stop (no Fly call)
#   --yes              do not ask for the commit to be typed back
#
# It refuses to deploy onto an app with more than one Machine, and afterwards checks that the app has exactly one
# Machine and no IP address. Never add `set -x`.
