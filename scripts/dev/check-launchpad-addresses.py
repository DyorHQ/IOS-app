"""Every place the app learns the launchpad's and Moments' live addresses must agree with contracts/deployments/.

Checks the DyorKit constants (LaunchpadAddresses.monadMainnet against 143.json, MomentsAddresses.monadMainnet against
moments-143.json) and — when they set the keys — the gitignored local configs (ios Secrets.xcconfig, and the .env /
.env.local that scripts read). Also fails when a live record's factory is a retired one, or when a local config holds a
retired payout wallet. Exit 1 on any problem. Run after a redeploy and before a release.

The v2 addresses are unknown until the owner deploys, so each DyorKit block may be PENDING: every module `.zero` under a
`// PENDING` marker. A pending block is fine only while its live record is not promoted yet (143.json still names the
relaunch factory 0x6B1C…, moments-143.json still cohort 3, 0x0FD4…), so the Swift wiring and the record promotion land
together. `--release` is the archive gate (the DyorHQ target's install-only build phase in ios/project.yml,
ios/ci_scripts/ci_post_xcodebuild.sh, ios/scripts/testflight.sh): it refuses while either block is pending.

The retired Moments cohorts (MomentLink.Cohort c1–c3) are final only by their pins: `finalMomentCount` names how many
Moments each has, and MomentsAddresses.retiredMainnetCoins every coin they minted. Every run checks the two tables agree
(each cohort's coins are ids 1…pin). `--chain` and `--release` also prove them on Monad with read-only eth_calls to a
keyless public RPC (never a transaction): each factory's momentCount() equals the pin, and its Moments' coins are
exactly its retiredMainnetCoins entries; a cohort that grew past its pin refuses, naming the new coins, and so does an
unreachable RPC. Cohort 3 alone need not be paused on chain: it stays open (owner decision 2026-09-28: the old stacks
are retired in the app only, and builds before 16 can still publish there), so its publishingPaused() is read and
reported as a note, and its count is proven again by every release. Cohorts 1 and 2 must stay paused (their policy
pays the retired wallets): an open one refuses. `--chain` runs the same checks by hand; `--release` includes them.
Names do not follow the pins: MomentLink.Cohort.namedMomentCount freezes how many of each retired cohort's Moments have a
name link (NAMED_MOMENTS here, never changed), so raising a pin for a Moment published later takes in its coin and
moves no link. Every run checks the Swift still says NAMED_MOMENTS, and no more than the pin.

The same reads prove the live stacks, once wired, so a wrong record promoted with Swift that matches it (the simulated
dryrun-143.json, a fork rehearsal's, another deployment's) still refuses: every module in DyorKit's two tables has code;
the launchpad factory's hook(), escrow(), holderFeeSharing() and router() are the table's, its owner() is 143.json's and
modulesSealed() is true; the Moments factory's collect(), vesting(), graduation(), locker(), feeHook() and buyback() are
the table's, externalBaseURI() is the c4 link base, policy() pays the table's platform and treasury, and governance()
and guardian() are moments-143.json's; and each factory has no code at its record's deployBlock − 1 and has it at
deployBlock. The two live factories are also pinned here (LIVE_LAUNCHPAD, LIVE_MOMENTS), as the keepers pin them
(LIVE_FACTORIES in contracts/keepers/lib/deployments.mjs): Swift and a record that agree on any other factory refuse on
every run, chain or not. Move the pins with the records when a new stack goes live.

`--release` also reads the public docs' Contracts & Addresses page, which Get Help opens, at the URL the app opens
(DyorKit's DocsLinks.contractsAndAddresses), with a plain HTTPS GET, and compares it with DyorKit's two tables (every
address, case-insensitive; the first LaunchpadFactory and MomentsFactory rows as the page reads). What it finds is a
note, never a refusal (owner decision 2026-10-01: the docs page doesn't gate a release, and some addresses are kept off
it on purpose): an address the page doesn't show, a retired factory it presents as current, or a page that can't be
read is printed for the release checklist, and the archive goes ahead.

`--chain-fixture FILE` is for DyorKit's RetiredCohortGateTests only: the chain checks alone (the retired cohorts, and the
live stacks when wired) and the docs check, against canned eth_call and eth_getCode answers and a canned page instead
of the chain and the docs site. It is refused together with `--release`.

Local config values are compared, never printed: a problem there names the key only.
